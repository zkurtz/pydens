# pydens, density estimation in python

**pydens** provides a unified interface to several density estimation packages, 
including an implementation of 
[classifier-adjusted density 
estimation](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e4e6/033069a8569ba16f64da3061538bcb90bec6.pdf).
Examples in the `/notebooks` directory include
- [Basic usage and testing](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zkurtz/pydens/blob/master/notebooks/demo.ipynb)
- [Identifying the common and the rare in Census data](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zkurtz/pydens/blob/master/notebooks/census_demographics.ipynb)
- [Modest performance on an anomaly detection benchmark](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zkurtz/pydens/blob/master/notebooks/vowels.ipynb)

Applications of density estimation include
- **Detecting data drift**: The reliability of a trained model's prediction at a new data point
depends on the similarity between the new point and the training data. A
density function trained on the training data can serve as a warning of data drift
if the evaluated density at the new point is exceptionally low. One way to focus such an
analysis is to train and evaluate the density using only several of the most-important 
features in the model.
- **Mode detection**: Locating regions of high density is a first step to efficiently
allocate resources to address an epidemic, market a product, etc.
- **Feature engineering**: The density at a point with respect to any 
subset of the dimensions of a feature space can encode useful information. 
- **Anomaly/novelty/outlier detection**: A "point of low density" 
is a common working definition of "anomaly", although it's not the only one. 
(In astrostatistics, for example,
 a density spike may draw attention as a possible galaxy.)

Evaluating the performance of a density estimator is not straightforward. We rely on a 
mix of simulation, real-data sanity checks, and cross-validation in special cases, 
as detailed in our 
[evaluation guide](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zkurtz/pydens/blob/master/notebooks/performance_metrics.ipynb).
